# Simple Reverse Shell
Here is a simple reverse shell server and client script I created on my ethical hacking journey.

## How to run:
* Have Python2.7 installed
* Clone the repository
* Open 2 command line terminals
* Navigate to where the cloned folder is
* Run server.py first on one terminal and reverse_shell.py on the 2nd terminal
  - to run, type "./server.py" or "python2 server.py". Repeat this for the reverse file.
  - Make sure your permissions are set to executable for each file

* to close, enter 'q' from the server
