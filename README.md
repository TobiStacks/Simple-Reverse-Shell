# Simple-Reverse-Shell
Here is a simple reverse shell server and client script I created on my ethical hacking journey!

## How to run:
* Clone the repository
* Open 2 command line terminals
* Navigate to where the cloned folder is
* Run server.py first on one terminal and reverse_shell.py on the 2nd terminal
  - to run on Linux, use './server.py'. On Windows, use 'python server.py' and repeat for the reverse shell file
  - Make sure your permissions are set to executable for each file

* to close, enter 'q' from the server
